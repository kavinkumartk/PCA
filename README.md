# ðŸ“š PCA Visualization of Wine Quality Dataset

## âœ… Objective
Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA to visualize the wine quality dataset in 2D space and observe how samples distribute based on wine quality.

---

## âœ… Dataset
- **File**: `winequality-white.csv`
- **Description**: White wine dataset with physicochemical features and wine quality as target.
- **Separator**: `;`

---

## âœ… Steps Performed

1. **Load Dataset**
2. **Separate Features and Target**
3. **Scale Features**
4. **Apply PCA (2 Components)**
5. **Visualize PCA Results**

## âœ… Usage Instructions
1. Place `winequality-white.csv` and `pca_visualization.png` in the working directory.
2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```
3. Run the script to generate the PCA scatter plot.

## âœ… Insights
- Visualizes the relationship between wine quality and input features in a reduced 2D space.
- Useful for detecting clusters, outliers, and variance explained by principal components.
